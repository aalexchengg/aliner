hi alina. this comes a little late because i couldnt figure out how the fuck to get the web hosting to work so then tried to download it as an .exe and theres a bunch of stuff but i got it through 1!!!!!!!! happy birthday :') congratulations on living nineteen years i guess. i realize now that im writing this that i might have left way too much space but oh well.
to prepare for this, i googled how to write a love letter and the results were honestly pretty shit
here are some of my favorites:
"Just text a picture of your genitals. Isn't that what the kids are doing these days?"
"Pen, paper, words from the heart. Simple."
"Dear GF/SO, I love you."
these mfs have never written a love letter in their lives.
then i read more and these mfs were either writing poems and like instilling the spirit of fucking robert frost into their letters or deadass making song parodies.
i think if i ever made a song parody it would actually be so wraps. it would be fire !!!!!! but it would be wraps
i miss you a lot these days
i dont think its a feeling i really understood until this ldr because its like. yes i miss you but like it is so much more than that. like there are times throughout every day where it is like
oh, i wish she were lying her with me 
oh, i wish she could see this sunset that i am seeing
oh, i wish she could watch me park at an absolutely devastating angle (i promise im good at driving)
and im grateful that throughout these few months we were able to figure out ldr and you were always there no matter what
ive been at this letter for an hour now and i think ive deleted enough sentences to write america a new constitution
also if u want i had a lot more stuff loaded up but itll take like another week to code :skull: but pls lmk if u want it cos i am very down to do it
i think i will take all the advice google has given me to wrap this up
peenis
i love you - alex
